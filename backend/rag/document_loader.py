"""
document_loader.py - Handles loading and splitting documents

WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
    1. Reads documents from files (.txt, .pdf)
    2. Splits them into smaller chunks (because LLMs have token limits)
    3. Returns these chunks ready to be embedded into vectors

THINK OF IT LIKE:
    Imagine you have a big encyclopedia. Before you can index it,
    you cut it into individual pages or sections. That's what this does.

    """
    Split large documents into smaller chunks.

    WHY DO WE SPLIT DOCUMENTS?
    - LLMs have limits on how much text they can process at once
    - Smaller chunks = more precise retrieval
    - We can find the EXACT section that answers the question

    HOW DOES SPLITTING WORK?
    - chunk_size=1000: Each chunk is ~1000 characters
    - chunk_overlap=200: Chunks overlap by 200 characters so we don't
      lose context at chunk boundaries

    Example:
        Original: "...The company policy is ABC. Employees must XYZ..."
        Chunk 1:  "...The company policy is ABC. Employees..."  (1000 chars)
        Chunk 2:  "...Employees must XYZ..."                    (1000 chars, overlapping 200)

        documents: List of Document objects
