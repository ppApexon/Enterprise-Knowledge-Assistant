embeddings.py - Handles converting text to vectors and managing FAISS vector store

WHAT IS AN EMBEDDING?
    An embedding is a way to convert text into a list of numbers (a vector).
    Similar texts will have similar vectors. This lets us find relevant
    documents by comparing numbers instead of reading full text.

    Example:
        "What is the leave policy?" → [0.23, -0.45, 0.89, ...] (1536 numbers)
        "Annual leave entitlement" → [0.24, -0.44, 0.91, ...] (very similar!)

WHAT IS FAISS?
    FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library that stores these
    vectors and lets us find the most similar ones super fast.
    Think of it as a specialized database for vectors.
