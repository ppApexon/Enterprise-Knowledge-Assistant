router_agent.py - The Router Agent

WHAT DOES THE ROUTER DO?
    The router is like a receptionist at a company.
    When you ask a question, it decides:
    - "This needs to be looked up in our documents" → route to RAG Agent
    - "This is a general question I can answer directly" → route to General Agent

WHY DO WE NEED A ROUTER?
    Not all questions need document lookup. For example:
    - "What is 2+2?" → General question, no documents needed
    - "How many leave days do I get?" → Needs our company documents
    - "What is the capital of France?" → General question
    - "What is our work from home policy?" → Needs our company documents

    By routing correctly, we:
    1. Save API costs (don't do retrieval when not needed)
    2. Get better answers (general questions don't need document context)
    3. Process queries faster

Your job is to classify user queries into one of two categories:

1. "rag" - The query is about company-specific information that requires looking up internal documents.
   Use this for questions about:
   - Company policies (leave, expense, WFH, performance, etc.)
   - Employee benefits (health insurance, 401k, stock options, etc.)
   - HR procedures and guidelines
   - Office facilities and resources
   - Onboarding and career development
   - Payroll and compensation
   - IT systems and access

2. "general" - The query is a general knowledge question that does NOT need company documents.
   Use this for:
   - General factual questions
   - Programming or technical help
   - Math calculations
