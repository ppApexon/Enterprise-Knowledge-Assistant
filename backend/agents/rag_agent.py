WHAT IS RAG?
    RAG = Retrieval-Augmented Generation

    It's a technique where BEFORE generating an answer, you first:
    1. RETRIEVE relevant information from your knowledge base
    2. AUGMENT the LLM prompt with this retrieved information
    3. GENERATE an answer based on the retrieved context

    WHY IS THIS POWERFUL?
    - The LLM uses your actual company documents, not just training data
    - Answers are grounded in real, current information
    - Reduces "hallucinations" (LLM making things up)
    - You can cite sources!

FLOW:
    User Query → Retrieve Documents → Build Prompt → LLM → Answer
